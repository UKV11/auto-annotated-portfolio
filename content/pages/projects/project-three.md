Dataset
The dataset used in this project is sourced from Our World in Data. It contains information about COVID-19 cases, deaths, and vaccination rates globally.

Research Questions
How do changes in COVID-19 vaccination rates relate to new cases in 2022?
How do changes in vaccination rates affect the number of deaths due to COVID-19?
Methodology
Regression Analysis: To assess the relationship between vaccination rates, new cases, and deaths. Time-Series Analysis: To detect trends, seasonality, and residual effects of vaccination campaigns.

Key Steps
Data Preprocessing: Cleaning and formatting the data, handling missing values.
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Generating descriptive statistics, visualizations (scatter plots, histograms).
Regression Models: Building and evaluating linear regression models to find correlations.
Time-Series Models: Applying ARIMA models to identify patterns over time.
Results
The analysis reveals that vaccination rates have a significant impact on reducing new COVID-19 cases and deaths across multiple countries. Countries with higher vaccination rates experienced fewer new cases and deaths in 2022.

Visualizations
This project includes: Histograms to represent vaccination rates and their effects. Scatter plots showing correlations between vaccination density and changes in cases and deaths. Time-series plots showing the trends over time.

Conclusion
The findings suggest that higher vaccination rates are associated with a decline in new cases and deaths, contributing to the global fight against COVID-19. These insights can help in planning more effective public health policies.
