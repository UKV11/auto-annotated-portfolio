I aimed to analyze and visualize crime hotspots across the United States to enhance public safety and support informed decision-making. Using publicly available FBI data and leveraging tools like AWS S3, EMR, and Quicksight, I processed large datasets to create an interactive dashboard. This project achieved its goals of identifying high-crime areas, analyzing state-wise crime trends, and providing actionable insights through dynamic hotspot mapping and trend analysis. The dashboard supports law enforcement, researchers, and individuals by improving resource allocation and increasing awareness of crime patterns, showcasing how technology and data visualization can address critical societal challenges.
